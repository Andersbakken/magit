<h1>Contributing</h1>

<h2>Github issue tracker and pull requests</h2>

<p>
  Magit is hosted on Github and also uses it for development.  Please
  <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/issues">report issues</a> and
  <a href="https://github.com/magit/magit/pulls">open pull requests</a>
  on Github only.
</p>

<h2>Mailing list</h2>

<p>
  To request help and for discussions between users use the
  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/magit/">mailing list</a>.
</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>
  We are aware that a workflow based on git-send-mail and git-am is
  more powerful.  It is also harder to learn.  There was no decision
  to use Github almost exclusively for these tasks &mdash; it has just
  evolved that way.  It appears this is what most contributors prefer.
</p>

<p>
  While we would like to support a workflow native to Git, doing so in
  parallel to the use of Github is not an option at the moment.
  Things like duplicated issues and discussions would increase the
  workload for us maintainers to much.  This might change at some
  point but not now.
</p>

<p>
  We are also considering moving the mailing list to a mailman host
  and using it to discuss big changes.  But as of right now you have
  to follow the issue tracker on Github to be up-to-date with the
  latest development.
